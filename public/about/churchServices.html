        <p>The first mass on Sunday begins at 8am in summers and 8.30am in winters. It is a traditional Sung Eucharist service, with the prayers chanted in beautiful melodies that fill the Cathedral. The service is interspersed with classic English hymns. The sermon acts as the median between the first part of the service consisting of reading and meditating on the Word of God, and the the second part which is the preparation and participation in the Holy Communion. The service is followed by fellowship and refreshments.</p>

        <p>The Fellowship begins at 10 PM in summers and 10.30 PM in winters. The timing is chosen in such a way that youngsters from all 3 congregations (English, Tamil & Hindi) can attend it. Beginning with a few songs of worship and praise, the youth are led into a time of intercessory prayer. The prayer sessions include all relevant topics such as world problems, prayers for the nation, for examinees, for the church, its members and activities and lastly for themselves too. These prayers are conducted in various forms including two by two, small groups, as well as corporate prayers. The prayer session is followed by meditation on the Word for a brief period of time and ends with offering. In a recent effort to inculcate the habit of proclaiming the Word, one CYF member is encouraged every 2-3 months to bring the message on one of the Sundays.</p>
        <p>We also have a Bible Quiz every 2 months to encourage in-depth study of the Word.</p>
        <p>In an effort to integrate the Youth with the main worship service, everyone is requested to attend their respective worship services inside the church on the last Sunday of every month. </p>

        <p>The fourth mass on Sunday begins at 6pm in summers and 5.30pm in winters. It is a bi-lingual service, mixed in English and Hindi. This is the youngest service of the lot, initiated recently in September 2016. The service begins with half an hour of worship lead by the church youth, mainly consisting of modern worship songs in English and Hindi. This is followed by half an hour of meditating on the word of God by preachers from different churches in Delhi every week. The theme for each week is different. This helps in getting greater perspective on God’s Word. The service is followed by fellowship and refreshments.</p>
